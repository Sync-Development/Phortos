                                  Biotechnology and Genomics, Technical University of Madrid. For the past 15 years, Mark’s laboratory has focused on designing biomedical data/tool representation, discovery, and automated reuse infrastructures - what would now be called "FAIR".  Mark is co-author of the primary FAIR Data Principles paper, and lead author on the first paper describing a complete implementation of those principles over legacy data.  He is a founding member of the FAIR Metrics working group, tasked with defining the precise, measurable behaviors that FAIR resources should exhibit.  Mark’s laboratory's flagship technologies are Semantic Automated Discovery and Integration (SADI) and Semantic Health and Research Environment (SHARE).  SADI enables FAIR discoverability for analytical algorithms in biomedicine, where the algorithms natively consume FAIR data; as such, SADI design practices are perfectly suited for deployment on the emergent Web of FAIR Data and Services.  SHARE supports automated query resolution over globally distributed resources through intelligent matchmaking between data and required services, and automated workflow orchestration.  SHARE won a "best demonstration" award in 2010 for supporting the construction and resolution of natural language queries in a variety of languages.  Beyond data integration, we have extensive machine-learning experience over a diverse range of data types, from semantically enriched fragments of analytical biomedical workflows, to longitudinal microbiome data, and were the first to identify shifting “states” in microbiomes that could be attributed to specific interventions, opening-up a new approach to microbiome engineering.</p>

In this group Gian has directed an Excellence Center on the area of Semantic Interoperability in Government. He is also an Associate Researcher at the Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA), Institute for Cognitive Science and Technology (ISTC), Italian National Research Council (CNR), in Trento, Italy. <br><br>
